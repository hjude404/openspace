        <p>In the beginning, three unique personalities came together to effectuate a purposeful vision to enhance the educational experience in classroom. Gary, Judah and I joined forces to tackle a common problem found in the classroom. I was the visionary
            (in Gary's words) who originated the idea of an app where students can feel free to ask questions and be involved in the classroom without insecurities or ridicule. Judah's leadership and proficient coding skills helped keep us on task and
            brought our ideas to the screen, literally. Gary was the charismatic and vivacious entity in the group, and never failed to bring a smile to our faces; he brings that same charisma to his graphic design skills. There is certainly so much more
            OpenSpace can do in the future, but we hope you are satisfied with our current application, and can't wait for you to see what we do next!</p>
